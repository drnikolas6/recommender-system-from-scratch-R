The idea of the project is to create a recemmender system from scrath in R. The recommendation will consider both content based
and collaborative filtering methods (user based and item based). Eventualy the system is evaluated using the Recommender System package
that already exists in R repository.

train-test-1.R : Is an evaluation of the existing recommender system
train-test-2.R : Is an evaluation of the recommender system methods built form scratch
The code includes some commented lines of code that were not deleted so they can be used in alternative methods or they were used to test certain issues.
